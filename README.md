# MovieDock

Hello! If you are reading this, you have downloaded my new program. The program I created provides you with movie recommendations, along with critic thoughts/summaries about the movie, depending on which film you choose. Stay tuned for the updates and additons of even more movies. Thank you for downloading, and happy Movie Docking!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'movie_dock'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movie_dock

## Usage

Open application in Terminal. Once in terminal, use cd movie_dock, and then type in ./bin/movie_dock
After this, you will be given a menu with the initial genres I have implemented. Type in which one you would like to see a movie about, and once entered, a movie recommendation will pop up, along with it's summary. If you watch it and like it, great! If you do not like it, re-watch it. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
